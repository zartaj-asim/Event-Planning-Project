# Event Planning Website.
The event-planning industry is a large industry and is worth billions of rupees. Karachi alone contributes 168 billion rupees. While wedding celebrations are an integral part of all cultures of Pakistan, organizing these events is a very hectic as well as time consuming process. Therefore our customers require a platform with the freedom to
shop whenever they want without having to travel. The inconvenience for the customers who do not live close to the shopping areas have to travel for their event shopping will be eased by this app.  

The application facilitates the users in the following ways:

• If the user is a buyer, they can use the services available to them and choose
from a variety of sellers. For instance, a hall at the desired location can be
chosen first and then the user can opt for other options such as stage
decoration, caterers, etc.
• Buyers can book services and we will receive their orders and the details. To
confirm the order their contact information is asked during bookings.
• If the user is a seller, they can provide the information as well as images to give
the customer a better idea of what services they will be getting. The app not
only bring the services to a one-stop for an event but also help promote and
increase small brand recognition.
• The application also provides a communication portal for users to message the
service providers for queries. The 24/7 communication support will help with
the queries and feedback.


The application is web as well as mobile based. Both the implementations are
connected to different databases.
